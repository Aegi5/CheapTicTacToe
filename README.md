# CheapTicTacToe

This program is a simple CLI Tic-Tac-Toe made out of boredom.
Cells are numbered from 1 to 9 and each player can enter a desired cell number to input its associated symbol "X" or "O".

There's many room for improvement:
- use a different cells layout (numbering cells from 1 to 9 to make it more user friendly made the code a bit awkward)
- make it detect mouse click instead of entering cell number
- add an AI
